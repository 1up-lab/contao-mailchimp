The fields that will be shown are managed through MailChimp's [`List fields and *|MERGE|* tags`](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/managing-subscribers/set-default-merge-values-for-a-list). You may also change the order of this fields: In MailChimp, go to Signup forms > General forms > Signup Form and rearrange the fields via drag'n'drop. You then have to import the new field order into Contao, by simply re-saving the MailChimp list in the back end.
